This is a fuel efficiency calculator and fuel cost estimator for Android/other devices by using Cordova.

Build Android APK: `cordova build android`

Run on a debugging `device: cordova run android`

## Todo:
 - Investigate why APK generated by cordova is ~50Mb (due to crosswalk-webview plug-in)
 - Use proper spacing instead of `<br><br><br><br><br>` in `index.html`
 - Test on other Android phones
 - Swipe to change screens
 - Other fuel consumption conversions eg. mpg
 - Create css and js folder, and move js out of main html
